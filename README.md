# Papersaver

Self hosting for drawings from [Paper](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper)

### Why did I do this?

I wanted a place on the Web for all of my little sketches to live. I did not want
to use Tumblr, Twitter, Flickr or any other third-party to be the canonical location
of all the images.

### What did I use?

 - [Wintersmith](https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith) - Static site generator in Node
   - http://davidtucker.net/articles/introduction-to-wintersmith
 - [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) - To pretend I actually know or have the version of Node I need


### What did I learn?

 - Learned how to use [Wintersmith](https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith) to generate static sites.
 - Learned the basics of [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).
 - Leanred how to use npm's `--save` and ``--save-dev` to keep `package.json` tidy.
